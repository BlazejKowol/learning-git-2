<h1>Oh No</h1>
<h3>Bring Me The Horizon</h3>
    <p>You don't have to lie, I know exactly where you've been
     Cause you're chewing off my ear while you're chewing on your chin</p>
    <p>No we're not on the level, you're just off your face
    It's not a state of mind though, your head's just in a state
    I may be on the outside but you're empty within It's getting kind of old now,
    I think it's time to pack it in</p>
    <p>Don't call it a party cause it never stops
    Now one is too many but it's never enough 
    Don't tell me you're happy cause this isn't love 
    So be careful what you wish for So be careful what you wish for</p> 
    <p>Who you're trying to fool, you know you're in over your head
    Cause you're holding onto heaven but you're hanging by a thread 
    No we're not on the level, you're just off your face 
    It's not a state of mind though, your head's just in a state 
    I may be on the outside but you're empty within 
    It's getting kind of old now, I think it's time to pack it in</p> 
    <p>Don't call it a party cause it never stops 
    Now one is too many but it's never enough 
    Don't tell me you're happy cause this isn't love 
    So be careful what you wish for So be careful what you wish for</p>

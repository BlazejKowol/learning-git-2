<h1>Oh No</h1>
<h3>by Bring Me The Horizon</h3>
    <p>You don't have to lie,<br> I know exactly where you've been
    <br>Cause you're chewing off my ear<br> while you're chewing on your chin</p>
    <p>No we're not on the level, you're just off your face<br>
    It's not a state of mind though, your head's just in a state<br>
    I may be on the outside but you're empty within<br> 
    It's getting kind of old now<br>
    I think it's time to pack it in</p>
    <p>Don't call it a party cause it never stops<br>
    Now one is too many but it's never enough<br> 
    Don't tell me you're happy cause this isn't love<br> 
    So be careful what you wish for<br> 
    So be careful what you wish for</p> 
    <p>Who you're trying to fool, you know you're in over your head<br>
    Cause you're holding onto heaven but you're hanging by a thread<br> 
    No we're not on the level, you're just off your face<br> 
    It's not a state of mind though, your head's just in a state<br> 
    I may be on the outside but you're empty within<br> 
    It's getting kind of old now, I think it's time to pack it in</p> 
    <p>Don't call it a party cause it never stops<br> 
    Now one is too many but it's never enough<br> 
    Don't tell me you're happy cause this isn't love<br> 
    So be careful what you wish for<br> 
    So be careful what you wish for</p>
